This includes vacations, meetings, interview trips, and other absences. 1.2 Communication Please use Halo for messaging service attendings rather than SMS. Please check our status prior to messaging nights and weekends. If we are listed as unavailable, please contact another Surgical Oncology attending or the CMC GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc attending on call. 1.3 Inpatients By in large, service attendings all wish to know about major changes in the status of our own patients. For most of the issues for which you would need to contact an attending at night, we would prefer that you HALO us directly rather than the on-call person. This desire is 24/7 (unless Halo says that attending is off). 1.4 ER admits We would ask to use a combination of communication for ER admissions. All patients must be discussed with an attending.  If the patient is stable, does not need surgery, etc. then we would ask you to contact the attending on call for GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc. Please contact them according to that attendings preferences (page, text, call, etc).  If the patient is unstable, may need surgery or will have ongoing and/or have intensive management needs the following day please HALO that patients surgical oncology attending directly. The difference is that this patient is sick - we would like to know about all of our sick patients. If the Surg Onc attending is listed as off within Halo then please contact the GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc on-call attending. 1.5 Medical Records Completing medical records in a timely fashion is critical for patient safety, billing, and compliance. Timeliness also demonstrates an understanding of how the world of surgery for which residents are being prepared functions. 1.6 Operative Logs Completion of operative logs is critical for board certification of the individual resident but also has implications for the appropriate assignment of residents to surgical rotations AND impacts the ability of the residency to maintain accreditation and recruit resident candidates. Residents who find it difficult to find time to maintain operative logs may find themselves excused from the operating room to complete them. Residents are expected to complete operative logs within two weeks of the end of the rotation. 1.7 Case Assignment The senior resident will be expected to make case assignments for junior residents and students. It in not necessary split the month by attending - splitting by case is acceptable as well. We also expect that both residents know all the patients rather than just for one attending. This helps with nursing questions, etc. 1.8 Clinic Clinic is an important part of a surgeons education, where decisions are made regarding diagnostic workup, patient evaluation, and treatment planning. The expectation is that all residents on the service attend clinic once per week. 1.9 Work Hours If the service workload jeopardizes your ability to abide by the work hour restrictions, you must notify an attending so that arrangements can be made. The service attendings are committed to abiding by work hour restrictions.

A running summary of events is recorded in the Shared Hospital Course under Inpatient Workflow Each day, this section is carried from note to note so that each progress note contains the cancer history and the daily events. The Progress Note then includes the date and a one-line summary of the operation performed and any intraoperative complications or events which impact the post-operative care. Each day, an additional line is added to the Shared Hospital Course which summarizes events for that day. This makes it possible to see within each Progress Note the pertinent events for the hospitalization. These events would include extubation, re-intubation, positive cultures, dates lines are inserted or removed, dates of removal of NG tubes and drains, and transfer to ward or re-admission to ICU. This chronology assists in treatment decisions (how old is the IJ line or when did we start antibiotics? or when is the planned antibiotic stop date?) but also makes the discharge summary much easier to prepare.

This tool is critical for the safe care of patients by the nigh team. If there are studies which are pending at the time of signout (CT scan, follow-up Hb), it is critical that a plan be in place for whom to notify with an abnormal or critical study. In general, Drs Hill and Salo are always available until 10pm. Attending notification plans (service attending vs covering attending) for unstable patients should be negotiated before nightfall. Weekend Signout The chief resident is responsible for making certain that the weekend rounding resident is familiar with the patients, their problems, and the plan of care. A signout email should be prepared Friday afternoon and forwarded to the service attendings by 6pm for their review. This signout can then be edited with the attendings notes and forwarded to the weekend rounding attending.

See IJ Port Abdominal access is obtained in one of two ways: Infraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port (Applied Medical Kii Fios First Entry Z-Thread Trocar) Veress needle inserted in LEFT upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical Z-Thread port. 5mm port in right upper quadrant, 5mm port in RLQ just lateral to rectus, 5mm camera port between RUQ and RLQ ports The transverse colon is now elevated (using the umbilical port, if used) and the ligament of Treitz is identified. The proximal bowel is arranged in a C configuration to confirm the proximal and distal ends of bowel. A site for placement of the jejunostomy is selected on the skin, left lateral and just superior to the umbilicus. A site is selected on the bowel in the most proximal site on the jejunostomy selected which would allow for placement of the jejunostomy without tension, but at least 20cm from ligament of Treitz. The proximal jejunum is sutured to the anterior abdominal wall with 2-0 silk. This is usually done with a 9 suture which is introduced into the abdomen with a needle driver Korean Style or Paraguayan Style. Two cm distal to this suture, a diamond of sutures is placed around the proposed tube site, and one suture placed distal to avoid torsion. The final arrangement of sutures is one proximal and one distal and 4-6 sutures around the tube. All sutures were marked with hemostatic clips to facilitate replacement of the tube via fluoroscopy should the tube become dislodged. Using Seldinger technique, a 16Fr Cook catheter introducer kit is placed within the jejunum. A MIC 14Fr jejunostomy tube (0301-14) with the tabs trimmed with a scalpel, is inserted through the sheath and positioned in the jejunum. The tube was secured with a suture of 0 silk. If a balloon tube is used, an 18Fr Cook dilater and sheath is used, followed by a MIC 14Fr jejunustomy tube (0200-14) and the balloon inflated with 7mL of sterile WATER. The tube is secured with 0 silk and dressed with a BioPatch and a Tagederm dressing. The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl, followed by dermabond. After dressings are applied, a Lopez valve is attached with the long Christmas-tree end placed into the jejunostomy tube.

If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port The insufflation pressure is decreased to 4mmHg and the abdomen vented to drop the pressure. A 30 degree scope is passed inferior to the falciform ligament into the left upper quadrant over the lateral segment of liver. The post of the scope is positioned to the left, allowing visualization of the lesser curvature of the stomach with the end of the scope near the left aspect of the falciform. A site for placement of the gastrostomy is selected on the skin, using a 22Ga needle as a finder. The site is marked, then infiltrated with local anesthetic and a 5mm transverse incision made. Endoscopy is performed and the following noted: Level in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barretts esophagus. Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus. A bite block is positioned (unless the patient is edentulous). The endoscope (usually a neonatal scope) is introduced into the esophagus and the video capture started. If the tumor will not allow passage of the scope, do not force the scope. Once the scope is passed into the stomach, the fundus and duodenal bulb are suctioned. The scope is then positioned for a conventional PEG placement. The abdomen is desufflated and the carbon dioxide turned off. The laparoscope is withdrawn from the abdomen. A 20Fr PULL PEG tube kit is opened. The snare and tube are passed to the upper operator. The snare is passed through the scope and opened in anticipation of the passage of the wire. The angiocath from the kit is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Once the snare has grasped the angiocath, the needle is withdrawn and the split wire passed through the Angiocath into the stomach. The snare is adjusted to grasp the split wire, which is pulled out through the mouth. The laparoscopic port site is considered clean. The PEG tube, once it is pulled through the mouth, is considered dirty. The right abdomen is covered with a towel to protect the laparoscopic site. The recording is now stopped. The split wire is joined to the PEG tube, which is pulled into place by the abdominal operator. The tapered portion of the tube will be the first source of resistance, which may require firm traction. The split wire (and PEG tube) is dropped of the table to the patients left. Once the tapered portion of the tube is through the abdominal wall skin, the next point of resistance will be the bumper of the PEG tube passing through the tumor. In general, if a 5mm neonatal scope can pass the tumor, a 20Fr PEG tube can pass as well. The tube is pulled into position and the measurement at the skin noted. The stomach is aspirated by the upper operator and insufflation is resumed at 8mmHg. Tension on the PEG tube is adjusted to allow apposition of the gastric serosa to the abdominal wall. If the tube is not easily apposed to the abdominal wall, T fasteners (GI Anchors) must be employed. The scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the First Step disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water. The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl.

If jejunostomy in place, it is usually prepped into the field. If there is an eschar at the jejunostomy site, this should be removed prior to prep. Jejunostomy is brought inferior and taped to skin (or sutured to skin with a 0 silk suture with a Keith needle) Shoulders are shifted to the right in preparation for corkscrew positioning Lateral positioners positioned with pad extending from greater trochanter inferiorly. Leather strap over thighs with strap inside of bars of lateral positioners Left arm on armboard Yassargil socket attached to headpiece of bed on left side. Well-leg holder attached to Yassargil socket and used to support right forearm (which will cross body) Right arm crosses body and is supported on well-leg holder.

Arm holder is dropped towards the floor enough that right arm is brought forward. Prep Chloroprep (two sticks) of abdomen, right chest, right axilla. Particular attention to prepping as far as possible to the left lateral side and the right lateral side. Nipple prepped into field. Drape Perimeter of field draped with 1000 (clear adhesive) drapes. Two blue plastic U drapes with center of the U on either lateral side with tails forming the perimeter of the field Trauma drape. All of right chest and axilla is kept within the field, as is the lateral aspect of the left upper quadrant. The field does not need to extend inferior to the umbilicus. In general, it is usually possible to keep all of these area in the field without cutting the drape, except in very large patients. Ioban over the surgical field after the trauma drape. Laparoscopic cords (gas, light cord, camera) to tower at left shoulder. Suction irrigator brought off field at left shoulder. Laparoscopic LigaSure (2 bars) and Bovie (30/30).

Comorbidities: Cardiopulmonary disease. If echo, ejection fraction and aortic valve area (if abnormal) Beta blockage: Note whether patient on home beta blockade and if so, whether home medication was taken the morning of surgery. Anticipated Intraop Problems: Possibility of tension left pneumothorax due to carbon dioxide entry into left chest during mediastinal dissection Expectation of ventilatory difficulties due to carbon dioxide entry into the right chest Gastric mobilization  Greater Curvature Gastric Mobilization After infiltration of 1% marcaine, 7cm upper midline incision made for handport. Small incision is made and pylorus palpated, if possible. Incision is centered over pylorus. GelPort inserted, and abdomen insufflated to 15mmHg. Two 5mm ports placed LUQ. Medial LUQ 5mm port placed in angle between left costal margin and interior edge of GelPort ring. Lateral LUQ 5mm port placed as far lateral as possible. Depending upon visualization, a third port may be required between these two and somewhat more inferior. If feasible, division of gastrocolic omentum starts by delivering transverse colon into GelPort and dividing ligament with cautery and LigaSure in the avascular plane just cephalad to transverse colon. Dissection proceeds as far proximal and distal and feasible. It is important to avoid damage to the right gastroepiploic artery. Colon is returned to abdomen and gastricolic ligament divided going using LigaSure, taking care to avoid the colon and the right gastroepiploic artery. Stomach is retracted to the patients right with the back of the left hand, placing the gastrocolic ligament (and short gastric arteries) on stretch. Left gastroepippoic artery divided with LigaSure near its origin. Short gastric arteries divided with Ligasure close to spleen. As superior aspect of short gastrics is reached, the dissection plane shifts medially to create a tunnel towards the base of the left crus. This places the most superior short gastric vessels on stretch and facilitates their division. Once all short gastric vessels divided, peritoneum tethering fundus to diaphragm is incised, and fundus brushed medially. If there is bleeding from the splenic hilum this is treated with suction, LigaSure, SurgiFlo, and packing with a vaginal tape with laparotomy ring. Dissection plane is brought medially and posterior attachments are divided between stomach and pancreas. This may require a Megadyne hook. Distal mobilization Attention is directed to mobilizing the lateral aspect of the duodenum. This can either be accomplished with the camera through a LUQ port and a 45 degree camera or by placing an additional 5mm port in the RLQ. Hook cautery is used to incise the connective tissue lateral and posterior to the duodenum. This is extended as far distal as the gastrocolic venous trunk. The gastrocolic ligament is now dissected distally, taking care to preserve the integrity of the right gastroepiploic vessels. An areolar plane generally exists between the fat pad containing the right gastroepiploic vessels and that containing the transverse mesocolon vessels. Left gastric artery Lymph nodes around the celiac axis and left gastric artery are now dissected. The extend of dissection depends upon the tumor location and the presence of nodes her either based upon imaging or palpation. Dissection begins on the superior edge of the pancreas, and proceeds superiorly to the right crus. The left gastric (coronary) vein is usually located to the left of the arery and is divided with the LigaSure. In a two-phase approach, the left gastric artery is now divided with a 30mm gray load (2.0mm) endoGIA linear stapler. For patients with mid-esophageal tumors, (for whom a four-phase approach is used), if there is any question about the resectability of the tumor, division of the left gastric gastric artery is generally deferred until the second abdominal phase. Mediastinal dissection The esophagus is now dissected circumferentially at the gastroesophageal junction. The peritoneum overlying the diaphragm is incised, and circumferential dissection of esopahgus performed. On the left side, it is helpful to distract the left crus laterally with a Prestige clamp placed on the left crus The right pleura is widely entered in otder to both facilitate the thoracic dissection of the esophagus and placing the conduit into the right chest in preparation for the final thoracic phase. Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the right chest during the first (of two) thoracic phases. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the abdomen by reaching up into the mediastinum to divide the esophagus above the tumor. This is only feasible for tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided with a 60mm Medium-Thich (purple) endoGIA TriStaple stapler. Division of Esophagus (Four-Phase) Penrose Drain (Four-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the chest. In order to facilitate the thoracic dissection, a 1/4 penrose drain is tied around the distal esophagus and the drain is slid cephalad into the mediastinum. The tails of the drain are directed into the right chest so that they can be grasped from the right chest during the thoracic phase and can be used to provide traction on the esophagus in order to Entry into right chest The pneumoperitoneum in the abdomen is vented and the gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. The bed is rotated to the left 20 degrees. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. Two 12mm ports are placed. The more superior is placed lateral and superior to the nipple. The inferior port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm U port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5 Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase) In patients with low-lying tumors, it is possible to divide the esophagus above the tumor from the abdominal approach. This evaluation is facilitated by review of the properative endoscopy (and EUS), and the PET scan, particularly the PET obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. After dissection of the mediastinum, a endoGIA stapler with a 60mm Medium-Thick (purple) load is inserted through a 12mm port either placed either through the GelPort or by upsizing the most lateral LUQ Construction of Conduit The distal esophagus and stomach is exteriorized through the GelPort. The lesser curvature vessels are divided with the LigaSure 7-9cm cephalad from the pylorus. The stomach is now placed on stretch along the greater curvature. An endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) stapler is used to construct a 5-6cm wide gastric tube. In constructing the conduit in a patient with a tumor of the GE jnction invading into the cardia, it is important to be certain that the staple line to construct the conduit stays clear of the tumor. Patients with tumors invading the cardia are at risk of a positive distal margin, meaning that microscopic tumor may be left in the wall of the gastric conduit. To make things more complicated, in patients with low-lying esophageal or GE junction tumors, not all of the length of the conduit are needed in order to reach to the level of the esophageal transection. After construction of the anastomosis, the extra cephalad portion of the conduit (near the angle of His) are excised as the additional gastric margin. In order to distinguish which portions of the conduit staple line which will be used to replace the esophagus and those which will be included in the additional gastric margin, both sides of the gastric conduit staple line are marked with sutures designated A, B, C, etc proceeding from the Angle of His to the antrum. The distal esophagus and GE junction are now sent for frozen section. Feeding jejunostomy The ligament of Trietz is identified and the jejunum is identified 20cm distal and marked with a directional suture. A site is selected to the left of the handport incision. A 16Fr Cook Introducer Kit is used to pass a 16Ga needle, followed by a J wire, through the left rectus muscle. A skin incision 4mm in length is made adjacent to the J wire. The 16Fr dilator and sheath are now passed through the rectus muscle and the dilator and wire removed. A 14Fr Jejunostomy Tube 0301-14 is selected and the wings trimmed off with a scalpel. The jejunostomy tube is passed through the peelaway sheath, which is removed. A pursestring suture 1.5cm in diameter is placed on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum. The pursestring is started and ends on the lateral aspect. A second 16Fr Cook Introduced Kit is used to introduce the J wire through the center of the pursestring. Placement of Drains Two (or three) 19Fr full-fluted Blake drains (72230) are placed: JP1: placed into the left pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the most lateral 5mm port site on the LUQ JP2: placed into the right pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the next most medial 5mm LUQ port site JP3: (optional) placed in the abdomen posterior to the left lateral segment of the liver and brought out through the most medial 5mm LUQ port site Transposition of Conduit The gastric conduit is now placed into the right pleura through the mediastinum, with the assistance of a laparoscopic Babcock and gentle pressure on the greater curvature with the fingers. Entrance into the R chest (Two Phase) For two-phase operations, ports are now placed into the right chest, as stated above . In similar fashion, the inferior pulmonary ligament in dissected and the lung reflected anterior. Anastomosis The right chest is entered and the right lung reflected anterior with the paddle placed in the superior/anterior port. The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy. The paddle retractor is now moved from the anterior/inferior port to the anterior/superior 12mm port and the lung reflected anterior and inferior. OrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil. The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures. The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device. The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (sock over shoe). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam. The anastomosis is completed by firing a endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) linear) across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is sent for pathologic exam as additional gastric margin. NG Tube A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle. Chest Tube A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated. Closure The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.

If PET shows disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes, trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) is optimal. If PET shows metastatic disease, patients are eligible for palliative chemotherapy with radiation for treatment of symptoms of dysphagia. If PET shows extra-regional lymph node disease, patient is at high risk for distant disease and can be treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation. "],["staging.html", "13 Staging", " 13 Staging The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy. The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with) The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups: Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those \\(\\geq\\) 3cm(Hollis et al. 2017) Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis. Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, PET is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis. Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering [Ripley 226] among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia. PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS [malik,claxton,1] showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm3, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm3. References "],["superficial.html", "14 Superficial Esophageal Cancer 14.1 Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)", " 14 Superficial Esophageal Cancer Superficial esophageal cancer is usually asymptomatic, which means that the diagnosis is generally made in the context of surveillance for Barretts esophagus. Nodular Barretts esophagus can be best evaluation with endoscopic mucosal resection, which can provide further staging information if an adenocarcinoma is found, such as depth of invasion, differentiation, and lymphovascular invasion. Larger lesions should first be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)? EUS is less sensitive for T1 lesions (Bergeron et al. 2014) -&gt; use EMR for diagnosis (Maish and DeMeester 2004) (Should nodular Barretts be evaluated with EUS prior to EMR?) T1a tumors have a low risk of nodal metastasis (Dunbar and Spechler 2012) 14.1 Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) For patients with nodular Barretts esophagus or small tumors judged to be T1 by endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) can be diagnostic and potentially curative.(Thomas, Singh, and Ragunath 2009) EMR also helps establish the difference between T1a and T1b compared with pathology (Worrell et al. 2018) EMR is likely sufficient for small tumors with favorable patholgic factors(Oliver Pech et al. 2014) (Nurkin et al. 2014): Size less than 2cm Lateral and deep margins clear Absence of lymphovascular invasion Well- or moderately- differentiated EMR: (Soetikno et al. 2005) See MOlina JTCVS 153:1206 EMR for high-grade dysplasia (Shaheen et al. 2009) EMR for low-grade dysplasia (Phoa et al. 2014) resulted in 25% riskd reduction in progression go HGD.

In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN+ disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a ___ % chance of failure to complete therapy.

The high rate of failure with surgery alone has led to development of adjunctive therapies. 16.1 Trimodality Therapy Trimodality therapy consists of chemoradiation followed by surgery. CROSS trial randomized 364 patients with resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors (75% adenocarcinoma) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisting of 4,140 cGy of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone.(Hagen et al. 2012) Clinical node-positive disease was present in 16%. Pathologic complete response was seen in 23% of adenocarcinoma and 49% of squamous cell carcinomas. Median overall survival was 49 months after trimodality vs 24 months after surgery alone (p=0.003). Squamous cell carcinomas appeared to have particular benefit, with a hazard ratio of 0.42 for squamous cell vs 0.74 for adenocarcinoma. Median survival was improved for adenocarcinoma from 27.1 months to 43.2 months, but the median survival for squamous cell increased from 27.1months to 81.6 months for squamous cell. Rate of R0 resection was higher with chemoradiation (92% vs 69% p&lt;0.001) andlocal recurrence rates lower (14% vs 34% P&lt;0.001), and peritoneal recurrence lower (4% vs 14% P&lt;0.001). Despite the relatively low dose of radiation, in-field recurrences were less than 5%. The primary cause of failure was distant disease (31%) and local/regional failure (14%).(Oppedijk et al. 2014) Alternative to carbotaxol is FOLFOX (SOG trial (Leichman et al. 2011)) Ongoing PROTECT trial compares FOLFOX to paclitaxel and carboplatin (Messager et al. 2016) See also Definitive ChemoRT 16.1.1 Neoadjuvant chemoRT for SCCA NeoCRTEC5010 (Yang et al. 2018) Meta-abalysis of chemoRT vs chemo (Zhao et al. 2018) 16.1.2 Neoadjuvant chemotheraphy followed by surgery POET Trial (Pre-Operative therapy in Esophageal adenocarcinoma Trial) treated patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction with either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU, leucovorin, cisplatin) followed by surgery or induction chemotherapy with the same agents, followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide).

In addition, chemoradiation was associated with a higher pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs 2%)(Stahl et al. 2009).

Median survival was 28 months overall, 47 months for those with cCR, 61 months for primary resection, 46 months for cCRs who did not undergo resection, and 29 months for those with salvage esophagectomy(Furlong et al. 2013).

This would be considered an excessive rate of operative mortality by modern standards. Unsurprisingly, there was no difference in overall survival between groups, in part because the surgical group had an excess 9% mortality rate from treatment. Two-year survival in the surgery arm was 40% vs 35% in the definitive chemoradiation arm. In the French FFCD trial, 444 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (90% squamous cell) were treated with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin with concurrent radiation.(Bedenne et al. 2007) Patients with a partial or complete clinical response to chemoradiation were randomized to either surgery or a boost of radiation. Patients who did not respond to chemoradiation were treated with surgery and were eliminated from the study. Only 259 of the original 444 patients (59%) went on to randomization, with the remainder (those not responding to chemoradiation) treated with surgery. Of the randomized group, median survival was 17.7months in the surgery arm versus 19.3months in the definitive chemoradiation arm. Like the Stahl study, treatment-related mortality in the surgical arm was high (9% versus 1%). #Active Surveillance EGD is poor predictor of pCR (Sarkaria et al. 2009) References "],["radiation.html", "18 Radiation", " 18 Radiation RTOG 94-05 clinical trial (Minsky et al. 2002) References "],["esophagectomy.html", "19 Esophagectomy 19.1 Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy 19.2 Transthoracic 19.3 Transhiatal 19.4 Three-hole 19.5 Extended lymphadenectomy 19.6 Salvage esophagectomy", " 19 Esophagectomy Three general approaches exist for surgical therapy. Trans-thoracic or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy(Visbal et al. 2001) removes the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest. The approach include an abdominal phase, during which an esophageal substitute is constructed (usually from stomach). A thoracic phase then removes the intrathoracic esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest cavity. A McKeown esophagectomy utilizes three surgical fields: abdomen, right chest, and neck. The right chest approach allows dissection of peri-esophageal lymph nodes, and the cervical incision allows removal of the total esophagus.(McKeown 1976) This approach is useful for tumors which involve the proximal thoracic esophagus, to ensure a negative margin. The cervical anastomosis carries a higher risk of anastomotic leak than a thoracic anastomosis, although the morbidity of a cervical anastomosis leak is less serious than that of a leak of a thoracic anastomosis. A transhiatal esohpagectomy approaches the esophagus from the abdomen through the hiatus and from neck. By blunt dissection the esophagus is freed up without the need for thoracotomy. An esophageal substute is then brought from the abdomen to the neck through the mediastinum(M. B. Orringer and Sloan 1978) (Mark B. Orringer et al. 2007)&lt;!  Orringer Ann Surg 2007 &gt; The operation is designed to avoid the pulmonary toxicity of the right chest approach. On the other hand, the blunt nature of the mediastinal dissection means that fewer lymph nodes are harvested than with a trans-thoracic approach. Randomized trial of transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection versus transhiatal esohpagectomy showed fewer pulmonary complications with the transhiatal approach. (Hulscher et al. 2002) Fewer lymph nodes were havested with a transhiatal appraoch. A post-hoc analysis showed that among patients with 1-8 positive lymph nodes, survival with improved with the extended lymph node dissection.(Omloo et al. 2007) Minimally-invasive approaches to esophagectomy are now common, with evidence for less perioperative morbidity than an open approach (Biere et al. 2012) (Zhou et al. 2015) Randomized trial of a hybrid MIE (with laparoscopy and thoracotomy) was associated with lower postoperative complications than open esophagectomy (Mariette et al. 2019) High volume (Birkmeyer et al. 2003) (Wouters et al. 2009) Siwert III lesions are considered gastric cancers (Rusch 2004) (Siewert, Stein, and Feith 2006) Laparoscopy may be helpful in Siewert III tumors (Graaf et al. 2007) 19.0.1 Preoperative Evaluation Dysphagia can be scored accordgin to Mellow et al (Mellow and Pinkas 1985): 0 No dysphagia 1 Dysphagia to normal solids 2 Dysphagia to soft solids (ground beef, poultry,fish) 3 Dysphagia to solids and liquids 4 Inability to swallow saliva 19.1 Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy Higher lymph node yield with MIE vs open approach [Kalff] 19.2 Transthoracic 19.3 Transhiatal 19.4 Three-hole 19.5 Extended lymphadenectomy 19.6 Salvage esophagectomy (Markar et al. 2014) (Swisher et al. 2002) References "],["eso_metastatic.html", "20 Metastatic 20.1 Palliative radiation 20.2 Chemoradiation vs chemotherapy in Stage IV", " 20 Metastatic 20.1 Palliative radiation Palliative radiation vs chemoradiation (Penniment et al. 2018) Radiation along favored over chemoradiation in the palliaitve setting (Penniment et al. 2018) 20.2 Chemoradiation vs chemotherapy in Stage IV (Guttmann et al. 2017) References "],["stents-for-malignant-disease.html", "21 Stents for malignant disease", " 21 Stents for malignant disease (Vakil et al. 2001) Review of guidelines 2010 Am Society GI (Sharma, Kozarek, and Practice Parameters Committee of American College of Gastroenterology 2010) References "],["eso_surveillance.html", "22 Surveillance 22.1 T1a treated with endoscopic resection 22.2 Tib treated with endoscoic resection 22.3 T1b treated with esophagectomy 22.4 Stage II or III treated with chemoradiation. 22.5 Locally-advanced treated with trimodality therapy", " 22 Surveillance 22.1 T1a treated with endoscopic resection EGD every 3 mo for first year, then every 6 months for second year, then annually(Shaheen et al. 2016) 22.2 Tib treated with endoscoic resection EGD every 3 mon for first year, then every 4-6 months for seond year, then annually CT chest/abdomen every 12 months for up to 3 years (as clinically indicated) 22.3 T1b treated with esophagectomy EGD every 3-6 months for first 2 years, then annually for 3 more years.
