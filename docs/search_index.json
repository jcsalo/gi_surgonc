This includes vacations, meetings, interview trips, and other absences. 1.2 Communication Please use Halo for messaging service attendings rather than SMS. Please check our status prior to messaging nights and weekends. If we are listed as unavailable, please contact another Surgical Oncology attending or the CMC GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc attending on call. 1.3 Inpatients By in large, service attendings all wish to know about major changes in the status of our own patients. For most of the issues for which you would need to contact an attending at night, we would prefer that you HALO us directly rather than the on-call person. This desire is 24/7 (unless Halo says that attending is off). 1.4 ER admits We would ask to use a combination of communication for ER admissions. All patients must be discussed with an attending.  If the patient is stable, does not need surgery, etc. then we would ask you to contact the attending on call for GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc. Please contact them according to that attendings preferences (page, text, call, etc).  If the patient is unstable, may need surgery or will have ongoing and/or have intensive management needs the following day please HALO that patients surgical oncology attending directly. The difference is that this patient is sick - we would like to know about all of our sick patients. If the Surg Onc attending is listed as off within Halo then please contact the GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc on-call attending. 1.5 Medical Records Completing medical records in a timely fashion is critical for patient safety, billing, and compliance. Timeliness also demonstrates an understanding of how the world of surgery for which residents are being prepared functions. 1.6 Operative Logs Completion of operative logs is critical for board certification of the individual resident but also has implications for the appropriate assignment of residents to surgical rotations AND impacts the ability of the residency to maintain accreditation and recruit resident candidates. Residents who find it difficult to find time to maintain operative logs may find themselves excused from the operating room to complete them. Residents are expected to complete operative logs within two weeks of the end of the rotation. 1.7 Case Assignment The senior resident will be expected to make case assignments for junior residents and students. It in not necessary split the month by attending - splitting by case is acceptable as well. We also expect that both residents know all the patients rather than just for one attending. This helps with nursing questions, etc. 1.8 Clinic Clinic is an important part of a surgeons education, where decisions are made regarding diagnostic workup, patient evaluation, and treatment planning. The expectation is that all residents on the service attend clinic once per week. 1.9 Work Hours If the service workload jeopardizes your ability to abide by the work hour restrictions, you must notify an attending so that arrangements can be made. The service attendings are committed to abiding by work hour restrictions. "],["staging.html", "2 Staging", " 2 Staging The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy. The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with) The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups: Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those \\(\\geq\\) 3cm(Hollis et al. 2017) Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis. Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, PET is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis. Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering [Ripley 226] among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia. PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS [malik,claxton,1] showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm3, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm3. References "],["superficial.html", "3 Superficial Esophageal Cancer 3.1 Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)", " 3 Superficial Esophageal Cancer Superficial esophageal cancer is usually asymptomatic, which means that the diagnosis is generally made in the context of surveillance for Barretts esophagus. Nodular Barretts esophagus can be best evaluation with endoscopic mucosal resection, which can provide further staging information if an adenocarcinoma is found, such as depth of invasion, differentiation, and lymphovascular invasion. Larger lesions should first be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)? EUS is less sensitive for T1 lesions (Bergeron et al. 2014) -&gt; use EMR for diagnosis (Maish and DeMeester 2004) (Should nodular Barretts be evaluated with EUS prior to EMR?) T1a tumors have a low risk of nodal metastasis (Dunbar and Spechler 2012) 3.1 Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) For patients with nodular Barretts esophagus or small tumors judged to be T1 by endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) can be diagnostic and potentially curative.(Thomas, Singh, and Ragunath 2009) EMR also helps establish the difference between T1a and T1b compared with pathology (Worrell et al. 2018) EMR is likely sufficient for small tumors with favorable patholgic factors(Oliver Pech et al. 2014) (Nurkin et al. 2014): Size less than 2cm Lateral and deep margins clear Absence of lymphovascular invasion Well- or moderately- differentiated EMR: (Soetikno et al. 2005) See MOlina JTCVS 153:1206 EMR for high-grade dysplasia (Shaheen et al. 2009) EMR for low-grade dysplasia (Phoa et al. 2014) resulted in 25% riskd reduction in progression go HGD. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a technique for deeper endoscopic removal of esophageal lesions using endoscopic cautery, which dissects through the submucosa. ESD has a higher rate of curative resection (Cao et al. 2009) albiet at the cost of prolonged operative times and increased risk of complications such a bleeding. (Repici et al. 2010) ESD takes more time and has higher R0 resection rate but similar recurrence erate at 2 eyars (Terheggen et al. 2017) Need for RFA of Barretts after EMR: (Haidry et al. 2013) Combination therapy with EMR and RFA results in lower rate of recurence than EMR alone.(O.

Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416] enrolled patients with T1-2 or T3N0 tumors to chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone. The majority of the tumors (72%) were squamous cell carcinoma.Postoperative mortality was significaly increased in the chemoradiation arm (11.1% vs 3.4%). Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176] French trial FREGAT(Markar et al. 2016) Retrospective review of the National Cancer DataBase failed to demonstrate a difference in survival of cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer with or without preoperative chemoradiation.(Speicher et al. 2014) A retrospective report from Johns Hopkins examined outcomes of T2N0 squamous cell carcinoma patients and showed equivalent outcomes for primary surgery vs neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (Zhang et al. 2012) 4.3 Staging of T2N0 Tumors The challenge for treatment decision-making is the limited sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound in ruling out pT3 or pN+ disease. In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN+ disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a ___ % chance of failure to complete therapy. Data from the Cleveland Clinic looked at 53 patients judged to be T2N0 by endoscopic ultrasound (uT2N0) were treated with primary surgery. Pathologic examination showed that 17 (37%) were understaged by endoscopic ultrasound, and were pathologic (pT3) in 4 or node positive (pN+) in 13 cases. These patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation.(Rice et al. 2007) It is critical, therefore, in patients for whom primary surgery is contemplated, to attempt to identify those with occult T3 or N+ disease.

PET detects occult metastasis in 10-20% of cases Kim et al. (2009 Mar-Apr). Among 129 patients with esophageal cancer, PET detected additional sites of disease in 41% and changed management in 38% (Chatterton et al. 2009) PET for restaging detects interval development of metastatic disease in 8-17% of cases (van Vliet et al. 2008) References "],["locally_advanced.html", "5 Locally Advanced Cancer 5.1 Trimodality Therapy 5.2 ChemoRT vs Trimodality therapy 5.3 GE Junction 5.4 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoRT 5.5 Postoperative chemoradiation", " 5 Locally Advanced Cancer Tumors that are T2N+M0 or T3NxM0 are considered locally-advanced. The high rate of failure with surgery alone has led to development of adjunctive therapies. 5.1 Trimodality Therapy Trimodality therapy consists of chemoradiation followed by surgery. CROSS trial randomized 364 patients with resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors (75% adenocarcinoma) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisting of 4,140 cGy of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone.(van Hagen et al. 2012) Clinical node-positive disease was present in 16%. Pathologic complete response was seen in 23% of adenocarcinoma and 49% of squamous cell carcinomas. Median overall survival was 49 months after trimodality vs 24 months after surgery alone (p=0.003). Squamous cell carcinomas appeared to have particular benefit, with a hazard ratio of 0.42 for squamous cell vs 0.74 for adenocarcinoma. Median survival was improved for adenocarcinoma from 27.1 months to 43.2 months, but the median survival for squamous cell increased from 27.1months to 81.6 months for squamous cell. Rate of R0 resection was higher with chemoradiation (92% vs 69% p&lt;0.001) andlocal recurrence rates lower (14% vs 34% P&lt;0.001), and peritoneal recurrence lower (4% vs 14% P&lt;0.001). Despite the relatively low dose of radiation, in-field recurrences were less than 5%. The primary cause of failure was distant disease (31%) and local/regional failure (14%).(Oppedijk et al. 2014) Alternative to carbotaxol is FOLFOX (SOG trial (Leichman et al. 2011)) Ogoing PROTECT trial ompares FOLFOX to paclitaxel and carbo (Messager et al. 2016) 5.1.1 Neoadjuvant chemoRT for SCCA NeoCRTEC5010 (Yang et al. 2018) Meta-abalysis of chemoRT vs chemo (Zhao et al. 2018) 5.2 ChemoRT vs Trimodality therapy The sensitivity of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus to chemoradiation has raised the question whether Stahl Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma randomized to induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, etopiside, 5FU with leuocovrin) followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent ciplatin and etopiside) followed by surgery compared with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation (6400cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etopiside).(Stahl et al. 2005) progression-free survival was better in the trimodality group (64.3% vs 40.7%) Treatment-related morality was substantial in the surgery arm (13% vs 4%). This would be considered an excessive rate of operative mortality by modern standards. Unsurprisingly, there was no difference in overall survival between groups, in part because the surgical group had an excess 9% mortality rate from treatment. Two-year survival in the surgery arm was 40% vs 35% in the definitive chemoradiation arm. (stahl4530?) In the French FFCD trial, 444 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (90% squamous cell) were treated with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin with concurrent radiation.(Bedenne et al. 2007) Patients with a partial or complete clinical response to chemoradiation were randomized to either surgery or a boost of radiation. Patients who did not respond to chemoradiation were treated with surgery and were eliminated from the study. Only 259 of the original 444 patients (59%) went on to randomization, with the remainder (those not responding to chemoradiation) treated with surgery. Of the randomized group, median survival was 17.7months in the surgery arm versus 19.3months in the definitive chemoradiation arm. Like the Stahl study, treatment-related mortality in the surgical arm was high (9% versus 1%). 5.2.1 Neoadjuvant chemotheraphy followed by surgery POET Trial (Pre-Operative therapy in Esophageal adenocarcinoma Trial) treated patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction with either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU, leucovorin, cisplatin) followed by surgery or induction chemotherapy with the same agents, followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide). The study failed to meet its accrual goal, but there was a suggestion of improved 3-year survival with preoperative chemoradiation (47.4% vs 27.7% p=0.07) as well as improved local control (76.5% vs 59%). In addition, chemoradiation was associated with a higher pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs 2%)(Stahl et al. 2009). A meta-analysis of 33 randomized trials further suggested a greater benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery(Pasquali et al. 2017) and a similar meta-analysis (Sjoquist et al. 2011) #Active Surveillance EGD is poor predictor of pCR (Sarkaria et al. 2009) 5.3 GE Junction (Siewert, Stein, and Feith 2006) 5.4 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoRT See NCCN pages M-25 and M-26 Stahl (Stahl et al. 2009) randomized patients to preoperative chemotherapy (A) vs preoperative chemotherapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation (B).

Trans-thoracic or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy(Visbal et al. 2001) removes the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest. The approach include an abdominal phase, during which an esophageal substitute is constructed (usually from stomach). A thoracic phase then removes the intrathoracic esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest cavity. A McKeown esophagectomy utilizes three surgical fields: abdomen, right chest, and neck. The right chest approach allows dissection of peri-esophageal lymph nodes, and the cervical incision allows removal of the total esophagus.(McKeown 1976) This approach is useful for tumors which involve the proximal thoracic esophagus, to ensure a negative margin. The cervical anastomosis carries a higher risk of anastomotic leak than a thoracic anastomosis, although the morbidity of a cervical anastomosis leak is less serious than that of a leak of a thoracic anastomosis. A transhiatal esohpagectomy approaches the esophagus from the abdomen through the hiatus and from neck. By blunt dissection the esophagus is freed up without the need for thoracotomy. An esophageal substute is then brought from the abdomen to the neck through the mediastinum(M. B. Orringer and Sloan 1978) (Mark B. Orringer et al. 2007)&lt;!  Orringer Ann Surg 2007 &gt; The operation is designed to avoid the pulmonary toxicity of the right chest approach. On the other hand, the blunt nature of the mediastinal dissection means that fewer lymph nodes are harvested than with a trans-thoracic approach. Randomized trial of transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection versus transhiatal esohpagectomy showed fewer pulmonary complications with the transhiatal approach. (Hulscher et al. 2002) Fewer lymph nodes were havested with a transhiatal appraoch. A post-hoc analysis showed that among patients with 1-8 positive lymph nodes, survival with improved with the extended lymph node dissection.(Omloo et al. 2007) Minimally-invasive approaches to esophagectomy are now common, with evidence for less perioperative morbidity than an open approach (Biere et al. 2012) (Zhou et al. 2015) Randomized trial of a hybrid MIE (with laparoscopy and thoracotomy) was associated with lower postoperative complications than open esophagectomy (Mariette et al. 2019) High volume (Birkmeyer et al. 2003) (Wouters et al. 2009) Siwert III lesions are considered gastric cancers (Rusch 2004) (Siewert, Stein, and Feith 2006) Laparoscopy may be helpful in Siewert III tumors (de Graaf et al. 2007) 8.0.1 Preoperative Evaluation Dysphagia can be scored accordgin to Mellow et al (Mellow and Pinkas 1985): 0 No dysphagia 1 Dysphagia to normal solids 2 Dysphagia to soft solids (ground beef, poultry,fish) 3 Dysphagia to solids and liquids 4 Inability to swallow saliva 8.1 Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy Higher lymph node yield with MIE vs open approach [Kalff] 8.2 Transthoracic 8.3 Transhiatal 8.4 Three-hole 8.5 Extended lymphadenectomy References "],["eso_metastatic.html", "9 Metastatic 9.1 Palliative radiation 9.2 Chemoradiation vs chemotherapy in Stage IV", " 9 Metastatic 9.1 Palliative radiation Palliative radiation vs chemoradiation (Penniment et al. 2018) Radiation along favored over chemoradiation in the palliaitve setting (Penniment et al. 2018) 9.2 Chemoradiation vs chemotherapy in Stage IV (Guttmann et al. 2017) References "],["stents-for-malignant-disease.html", "10 Stents for malignant disease", " 10 Stents for malignant disease (Vakil et al. 2001) Review of guidelines 2010 Am Society GI (Sharma, Kozarek, and Practice Parameters Committee of American College of Gastroenterology 2010) References "],["eso_surveillance.html", "11 Surveillance 11.1 T1a treated with endoscopic resection 11.2 Tib treated with endoscoic resection 11.3 T1b treated with esophagectomy 11.4 Stage II or III treated with chemoradiation. 11.5 Locally-advanced treated with trimodality therapy", " 11 Surveillance 11.1 T1a treated with endoscopic resection EGD every 3 mo for first year, then every 6 months for second year, then annually(Shaheen et al. 2016) 11.2 Tib treated with endoscoic resection EGD every 3 mon for first year, then every 4-6 months for seond year, then annually CT chest/abdomen every 12 months for up to 3 years (as clinically indicated) 11.3 T1b treated with esophagectomy EGD every 3-6 months for first 2 years, then annually for 3 more years.
