\chapter{Overview}\label{Intro}}

\hypertarget{absences}{%
\section{Absences}\label{absences}}

Please notify Dr Hill, Dr Salo and Dr Squires before the beginning of the rotation if you will be away during the month. This includes vacations, meetings, interview trips, and other absences.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\section{Communication}\label{communication}}

Please use Halo for messaging service attendings rather than SMS. Please check our status prior to messaging nights and weekends. If we are listed as unavailable, please contact another Surgical Oncology attending or the CMC ``GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc'' attending on call.

\hypertarget{inpatients}{%
\section{Inpatients}\label{inpatients}}

By in large, service attendings all wish to know about major changes in the status of our own patients. For most of the issues for which you would need to contact an attending at night, we would prefer that you HALO us directly rather than the on-call person. This desire is 24/7 (unless Halo says that attending is ``off'').

\hypertarget{er-admits}{%
\section{ER admits}\label{er-admits}}

We would ask to use a combination of communication for ER admissions. All patients must be discussed with an attending.
• If the patient is stable, does not need surgery, etc. then we would ask you to contact the attending on call for GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc. Please contact them according to that attending's preferences (page, text, call, etc).
• If the patient is unstable, may need surgery or will have ongoing and/or have intensive management needs the following day please HALO that patient's surgical oncology attending directly. The difference is that this patient is sick - we would like to know about all of our sick patients. If the Surg Onc attending is listed as ``off'' within Halo then please contact the GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc on-call attending.

\hypertarget{medical-records}{%
\section{Medical Records}\label{medical-records}}

Completing medical records in a timely fashion is critical for patient safety, billing, and compliance. Timeliness also demonstrates an understanding of how the world of surgery for which residents are being prepared functions.

\hypertarget{operative-logs}{%
\section{Operative Logs}\label{operative-logs}}

Completion of operative logs is critical for board certification of the individual resident but also has implications for the appropriate assignment of residents to surgical rotations AND impacts the ability of the residency to maintain accreditation and recruit resident candidates. Residents who find it difficult to find time to maintain operative logs may find themselves excused from the operating room to complete them. Residents are expected to complete operative logs within two weeks of the end of the rotation.

\hypertarget{case-assignment}{%
\section{Case Assignment}\label{case-assignment}}

The senior resident will be expected to make case assignments for junior residents and students. It in not necessary split the month by attending - splitting by case is acceptable as well.~ We also expect that~ both residents know all the patients rather than just for one attending. This helps with nursing questions, etc.

\hypertarget{clinic}{%
\section{Clinic}\label{clinic}}

Clinic is an important part of a surgeon's education, where decisions are made regarding diagnostic workup, patient evaluation, and treatment planning. The expectation is that all residents on the service attend clinic once per week.

\hypertarget{work-hours}{%
\section{Work Hours}\label{work-hours}}

If the service workload jeopardizes your ability to abide by the work hour restrictions, you must notify an attending so that arrangements can be made. The service attendings are committed to abiding by work hour restrictions.

\hypertarget{inpatient}{%
\chapter{Inpatient}\label{inpatient}}

Colorectal Surgery (Davis/Kasten) and GI Surgical Oncology (Hill/Salo/Squires) will cover Pineville and CMC. For efficiency, the services at each hospital will merge for patient care. Each patient will continue to have an attending surgeon, but rounding and inpatient care will be provided by the service.

\hypertarget{admissions}{%
\section{Admissions}\label{admissions}}

Admitting Provider: ``CMC, GI SURGICAL ONCOLOGY''

\section{Resident Halo teams:}\label{resident-halo-teams}}

CMC AH Colorectal Surgery 1st Call
CMC LCI GI Surgical Oncology 1st Call
Residents will be assigned to Halo teams by schedule. It is critical that you notify service attendings before the start of the month to adjust the resident Halo schedule. Each ``shift'' is 5:50am to 6pm. At 6pm the resident Halo Teams will be forwarded to the night team.

Please append a text block to the bottom of each progress note specifying the Halo Team for that patient to facilitate communication from nursing.

\hypertarget{rounds-1}{%
\chapter{Rounds}\label{rounds-1}}

Please plan to update the attending of record about their patients in the morning.

The following format will help speed communication on rounds.

\textbf{ID}: One line description: ``Mr Glenn: PostOp day 3 after low anterior resection''

\textbf{24 hour events}: Summary of important events in prior 24 hrs

\textbf{Systems-oriented Presentation:}

Neuro: Pain control, level of alertness, psychotropic meds, sedatives, and pain meds.

CardioVascular: Vital signs (normal OR cite the range of systolic blood pressures and range of heart rate). Heart rhythm. Cardiac meds. Most recent recommendations of cardiology consult.

Respiratory: Pulmonary exam, oxygen saturation, supplied oxygen, ventilator setting. Results of CXR.

GI: Diet, bowel function, NG output. Drain outputs can often be summarized unless they are unusually high or low (and ready to be removed. New finding of bile in any abdominal drain needs special emphasis. GI meds (eg protonix, Entereg). Tube feed formula, rate and duration (continuous or nocturnal). Status of C Diff tests. Results of JP drain amylase levels (gastroesophageal patients). Results of JP triglycerides or creatinine, if sent,

Renal: Urine output in 24 hours AND in most recent 8 hour shift. Presence (or absence) of Foley catheter and plans for removal, if present. Most recent creatinine. If diuretics administered, dosage and amount of urine output during the shift when it was administered. Most recent potassium in any patient receiving (or about to receive) furosemide (Lasix). Results of Mg and Phos if abnormal.

Heme: Hemoglobin, platelets, DVT prophylaxis. PLEASE CHECK THE MAR SUMMARY DAILY to be certain that the ordered DVT prophylaxis has been given.

ID: WBC, Tmax in past 24 hours, culture results.

Endo: Diabetic regimen, blood sugar range, and amount of sliding scale insulin administered in the prior 24 hours.

\textbf{Problem-Oriented Plan:}

Each of the patients problems are addressed with an assessment and plan. Pre-existing medical problems and postoperative complications need to be addressed in the plan

\hypertarget{progress-notes}{%
\chapter{Progress Notes}\label{progress-notes}}

Progress notes should include a comprehensive summary of pertinent information for the patient's medical care.

A running summary of events is recorded in the Shared Hospital Course under Inpatient Workflow

Each day, this section is carried from note to note so that each progress note contains the cancer history and the daily events.

The Progress Note then includes the date and a one-line summary of the operation performed and any intraoperative complications or events which impact the post-operative care.

Each day, an additional line is added to the Shared Hospital Course which summarizes events for that day. This makes it possible to see within each Progress Note the pertinent events for the hospitalization. These events would include extubation, re-intubation, positive cultures, dates lines are inserted or removed, dates of removal of NG tubes and drains, and transfer to ward or re-admission to ICU. This chronology assists in treatment decisions (``how old is the IJ line'' or ``when did we start antibiotics?'' or ``when is the planned antibiotic stop date''?) but also makes the discharge summary much easier to prepare.

Assessment/Plan
The medical problems currently being managed are addressed in the assessment.

\textbf{Communication}

Please add an addendum at the BOTTOM of each progress note which includes a means for contacting the team:

Please message ``CMC LCI GI Surgical 1st Call'' via Halo 24/7. Messages are automatically forwarded to the General Surgery Resident on Call evenings and weekends.

\#Signout

\textbf{Evening Signout}

The Handoff Tool should be completed for all inpatients, and the responsible attending designated. This tool is critical for the safe care of patients by the nigh team. If there are studies which are pending at the time of signout (CT scan, follow-up Hb), it is critical that a plan be in place for whom to notify with an abnormal or critical study. In general, Drs Hill and Salo are always available until 10pm. Attending notification plans (service attending vs covering attending) for unstable patients should be negotiated before nightfall.

\textbf{Weekend Signout}

The chief resident is responsible for making certain that the weekend rounding resident is familiar with the patients, their problems, and the plan of care. A signout email should be prepared Friday afternoon and forwarded to the service attendings by 6pm for their review. This signout can then be edited with the attendings' notes and forwarded to the weekend rounding attending.

\hypertarget{discharges}{%
\chapter{Discharges}\label{discharges}}

\textbf{Discharge Prescriptions}

Prescriptions should be ideally be prepared the day prior to anticipated discharge and left in the patient's `soft chart.' According to North Carolina STOP guidelines, opioid prescriptions for postoperative patients should be for no more than a 7 day supply.

\textbf{Postop Clinic Appts}

Postoperative patients are generally seen for a Transition of Care visit within the first week

Discharge appointments are made by sending a message in Canopy the evening prior (preferred) OR the morning of discharge before 8am to:

LCI CMC GI, Clerical
Verona Jordan (Hill) OR Marsha Sukhdeo (Salo and Squires)
Stefanie Olson (Hill) OR Kendra Zacharias (Salo and Squires)

Please include the following information in the Canopy Message:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ward from which the patient is being discharged
\item
  Desired date for appointment
\item
  Need for Wound Ostomy RN appointment at same time (essential for new stomas)
\item
  Need for bloodwork at first visit
\item
  Other studies to be done same-day

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Upper GI
  \item
    Chest X-ray
  \item

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If messages cannot be sent in time, clinic schedulers can be reached at: Marsha Sukhdeo (Salo and Squires): 980-442-6110 or Verona Jordan (Hill): 980-442-6183.

If schedulers are not available, clinic RNs can be reached at: Stefanie Olson (Hill) 980-442-6146 or Kendra Zacharias (Salo and Squires) 980-442-6143.

For patients likely to go home over the weekend or holidays, please plan to send a canopy message before 3pm on Friday or the day prior.

The scheduler will respond with a message to the discharging resident AND to the ward CNL with the appointment time, which can be included within the discharge summary. Copies of the message will also be sent to clinical nurse leaders:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  11Tower: Sharon Hood
\item
  6Tower: Amy Peterson
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additional Appointments}

If followup appointments in additional to surgical followup are needed, these should be designated on the discharge orders. Particularly:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Primary Care Physician
\item
  Cardiologist (if new cardiac medicines)
\item
  Co-surgeons (Urology, Thoracic Surgery, GYN)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discharge Summary}

The discharge summary documents important events and complications in the postoperative course and serves to inform the referring physician and primary physician about these events, but also serves as a blueprint for post-discharge treatment planning. Please recognize that the first post-operative visit may be with a resident who may be meeting the patient for the first time. Key items to include:

\textbf{Communication}

It is essential that discharge summaries be sent to the patient's primary MD and referring physician. Please review the initial consultation note for the names of providers involved in a patient's care.

In order to easily access the patient's providers, please prepare a ``{]}Providers'' autotext:

Click the AutoText icon on a document
Add new AutoText by clicking the blue + sign
Create a name for the new AutoText (such as ``{]}Providers'')
Select a smart template by clicking the second icon from the right of the buttons
Search for ``Transition'' and select ``Transition Clinic Header''
Save the AutoText
Please paste the {]}Providers AutoText in the body of the discharge summary to easily access who should receive copies of the discharge summary

\hypertarget{student-emr-notes-policy}{%
\chapter{Student EMR Notes Policy}\label{student-emr-notes-policy}}

Approved: Medical Education Division of Canopy Team 11/17/13

Students:

Should write Notes in the EMR as a part of their training. Students must sign and forward their notes. It is imperative that student notes not be saved and forwarded prior to signing the note or the authorship of the note will change. Signed notes should be forwarded to the supervising physician as soon as possible.

Supervising physicians:

Attending must sign the necessary documents per the medical staff bylaws (e.g., H \& P's and Discharge Summaries). Attendings, residents, or fellows can cosign progress notes. Each attending should clarify who is responsible for signing progress notes.

Supervising physicians have 2 options:

Correct the note as needed, append an attestation, and sign within 24 hours. When appending the student's note, the supervising physician may utilize only the student's past medical history, family history, social history, and review of systems. This is the preferred model and the most efficient. Please see example below.*

Correct the note as needed, attest with reference to supervising physician's own note, and sign within 24 hours.

Example Attending Attestation*

I have discussed the presentation of the patient with the student. I have also independently seen and examined the patient. Please see my documentation below:

History: {[}As obtained by the provider{]}

Past History, Family History, Social History, and ROS: Please see the student's note above.

Physical Exam:

General: Well-developed, well-nourished

HEENT: Pupils equal react to light extra ocular motion intact, conjunctiva pink, anicteric sclera, oropharynx clear, moist mucosa

Neck: Supple, no meningeal signs

Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, bilateral breath sounds, normal effort

Cardiac: Regular rate normal rhythm, no murmur gallop or rub

Abdomen: Soft, benign, non-distended, non-tender, no mass

Extremities: Moves all 4 extremities, pulses 2+ and equal

Neurologic: Awake, alert, and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, moves all 4 extremities equally, speech is normal, affect pleasant

Skin: No rash

Labs, X-rays, Tests: {[}Pertinent comments regarding positives/negatives and interpretations{]}

Medical Decision Making: {[}MDM also should be attending documentation{]}

\textbf{Pre-op holding}

Please make sure that these ordersets have been placed prior to day of surgery. If inpatient consult, place these orders the morning of surgery in order to minimize confusion.

ADULT SURG Colorectal ERAS MPP Hill This is what has all of the main ERAS components. Tylenol, gabapentin, Decadron, Alvimopan and heparin are all given in pre-op holding

ADULT STANDING Antimicrobial colorectal In general, I will give Ancef to patients with almost all patients with allergies to PCN. They have to remember the ``severe'' reaction. If it is a severe reaction, please use the second line ABX listed in the power plan.

Type and Screen are not typically needed for colectomy. They will have an antibody screen from office. If antibodies present, then d/w attending

\textbf{Intra-op}

Positioning: I typically like to position myself.

Right sided=supine; Left sided=lithotomy; All laparoscopic colon cases will have their arms tucked with a chest tape strap.

NG/OG tubes Not needed. I will have anesthesia place if we have gastric distension. We give a multiple PO meds prior.

Review anesthesia fluid management during time out. 1.6L max volume, urine output not an accurate indicator.

\textbf{Prep}

Chloroprep: RIGHT chest, neck to chin and earlobe, shoulder to include deltopectoral groove.

\textbf{Drape}

1000 plastic drapes outline the sterile field for the port. The skin is stretched to avoid a gap between drape and skin. Allow access to the right sternocleidomastoid, right deltopectoral groove, and sternal notch.
Blue paper drapes on top of 1000 drapes
Transverse drape reversed head-to-foot.
Ioban around edges of port field. Skin over SCM is left without Ioban to facilitate ultrasound

\textbf{Preop evaluation}
Allergies
Blood thinners or anti-platelet agents
History of prior central venous lines or ports
History of neck surgery

\textbf{Operation}
Reverse Trendelenburg

Port pocket is constructed 1cm below and parallel to clavicle 3cm long. It is essential that there is no bleeding in the pocket (to avoid a port pocket hematoma).
Trendelenburg

Right internal jugular vein is identified and its course cephalad-caudad marked on the skin.

Finder needle (22Ga) passed into IJ. The needle should enter the vein directly beneath the ultrasound probe.

Skin anesthetized and transverse 8mm incision at needle entry site

Respirations held by anesthesia

16Ga needle passed into IJ under sono. It is essential that the vein is scanned up and down by `rocking' the probe to visualize the tip of the needle as it passes inferior.

J Wire passed through 16Ga needle and needle withdrawn

Anesthesia resumes respirations

Ultrasound used to confirm presence of wire within the vein by scanning up and down.

Level bed

Fluoroscopy used to confirm position of wire. Dilator and sheath inserted under fluoroscopic visualization (`live'). C-arm backed away off field.

Tunneler connected to tubing on the end with small numbers. Confirm that the collar is in place and place hemostat on the end of the tubing with large numbers (to avoid allowing the collar to fall off). Tunneler bent into a curve to avoid injury to the carotid artery.

Catheter tunneled from port pocket to counter-incision over SCM. The tunneler path describes a gentle arc to avoid kinking the catheter. 1 cm of catheter near tunneler trimmed.

Catheter placed through dilator into central circulation. Most of the catheter is inserted. The catheter will generally not cause arrhythmias.

C-arm brought back onto field.

Peel-away sheath split and removed.

Traction on catheter from the port pocket is used to position catheter approximately 3cm below carina. It may be necessary to `orbit' the C-arm if the catheter overlies the spine.

Port pocket is measured and catheter trimmed (after sliding collar superior) and attached to port. It is essential that the catheter come to rest within 1mm of the port before locking the collar in place. In order to avoid pulling on the catheter (and changing the position of the catheter tip) the port is rotated (not the catheter). Collar is locked in place.

Port accessed with straight Huber needle with 100U/ml heparinized saline. Blood is withdrawn into port. Needle is left in the port and the syringe detached. Syringe with concentrated flush (1000U/ml) is attached to the needle and the port flushed (without aspiration of blood). Syringe and needle are removed.

Port sutured to the underlying pectoralis fascia with 2 sutures of 3-0 Prolene, one forehand and one backhand. Sutures are tied and cut.

The port pocket irrigated and the incision closed with subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl followed by subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl. The skin is dressed with Dermabond.

\textbf{Indications}

Laparoscopic jejunostomy is used for enteral nutrition in patients prior to planned (or possible) esophagectomy or gastrectomy or those for whom the stomach is otherwise not available (ie after esophagectomy or gastrectomy). Patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who need enteral access are generally treated with a gastrostomy, which does not require feeding with a pump

\textbf{Operation}

If a central venous port is placed, the port is performed first. See \protect\hyperlink{cv_port_salo}{IJ Port}

Abdominal access is obtained in one of two ways:

Infraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port (Applied Medical Kii Fios First Entry Z-Thread Trocar)
Veress needle inserted in LEFT upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical Z-Thread port.
5mm port in right upper quadrant, 5mm port in RLQ just lateral to rectus, 5mm camera port between RUQ and RLQ ports

The transverse colon is now elevated (using the umbilical port, if used) and the ligament of Treitz is identified. The proximal bowel is arranged in a ``C'' configuration to confirm the proximal and distal ends of bowel.

A site for placement of the jejunostomy is selected on the skin, left lateral and just superior to the umbilicus. A site is selected on the bowel in the most proximal site on the jejunostomy selected which would allow for placement of the jejunostomy without tension, but at least 20cm from ligament of Treitz.

The proximal jejunum is sutured to the anterior abdominal wall with 2-0 silk. This is usually done with a 9″ suture which is introduced into the abdomen with a needle driver ``Korean Style'' or ``Paraguayan Style.'' Two cm distal to this suture, a diamond of sutures is placed around the proposed tube site, and one suture placed distal to avoid torsion. The final arrangement of sutures is one proximal and one distal and 4-6 sutures around the tube. All sutures were marked with hemostatic clips to facilitate replacement of the tube via fluoroscopy should the tube become dislodged.

Using Seldinger technique, a 16Fr Cook catheter introducer kit is placed within the jejunum.

A MIC 14Fr jejunostomy tube (0301-14) with the tabs trimmed with a scalpel, is inserted through the sheath and positioned in the jejunum. The tube was secured with a suture of 0 silk.

If a balloon tube is used, an 18Fr Cook dilater and sheath is used, followed by a MIC 14Fr jejunustomy tube (0200-14) and the balloon inflated with 7mL of sterile WATER.

The tube is secured with 0 silk and dressed with a BioPatch and a Tagederm dressing.

The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl, followed by dermabond.

After dressings are applied, a Lopez valve is attached with the long Christmas-tree end placed into the jejunostomy tube.

Endoscopy
The scope is set up:

Suction and aspiration valves inserted and working
Suction tubing attached
Biopsy valve attached and not leaking
Cart set up for recording by powering on the Stryker SDC digital capture box
A bite block is used and the scope lubricated. A neonatal scope may be necessary in patients with a tight stricture. Important findings to record:

Level in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett's esophagus.
Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction
Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.
The scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the `First Step' disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.

\textbf{Indications}

Laparoscopic gastrostomy is used in patients with esophageal obstruction . Gastrostomy feedings are much easier than jejunostomy, as they can be administered via syringe or gravity bag. By contrast, jejunostomy feedings require administration via pump. Gastrostomy is usually done as an outpatient unless there are concerns for refeeding.

\textbf{Operation}

If a central venous port is placed, the port is performed first. See \protect\hyperlink{cv_port_salo}{IJ Port}

\textbf{Abdominal access} is obtained in one of two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Veress needle inserted in left upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical port at lateral border of rectus just superior to umbilicus
\item
  Infraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port
\end{itemize}

The insufflation pressure is decreased to 4mmHg and the abdomen vented to drop the pressure. A 30 degree scope is passed inferior to the falciform ligament into the left upper quadrant over the lateral segment of liver. The post of the scope is positioned to the left, allowing visualization of the lesser curvature of the stomach with the end of the scope near the left aspect of the falciform.

A site for placement of the gastrostomy is selected on the skin, using a 22Ga needle as a finder. The site is marked, then infiltrated with local anesthetic and a 5mm transverse incision made.

Endoscopy is performed and the following noted:

Level in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett's esophagus.
Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction
Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.
A bite block is positioned (unless the patient is edentulous). The endoscope (usually a neonatal scope) is introduced into the esophagus and the video capture started. If the tumor will not allow passage of the scope, do not force the scope.

Once the scope is passed into the stomach, the fundus and duodenal bulb are suctioned. The scope is then positioned for a conventional PEG placement.

The abdomen is desufflated and the carbon dioxide turned off. The laparoscope is withdrawn from the abdomen.

A 20Fr PULL PEG tube kit is opened. The snare and tube are passed to the upper operator. The snare is passed through the scope and opened in anticipation of the passage of the wire.

The angiocath from the kit is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Once the snare has grasped the angiocath, the needle is withdrawn and the split wire passed through the Angiocath into the stomach. The snare is adjusted to grasp the split wire, which is pulled out through the mouth.

The laparoscopic port site is considered clean. The PEG tube, once it is pulled through the mouth, is considered dirty. The right abdomen is covered with a towel to protect the laparoscopic site.

The recording is now stopped. The split wire is joined to the PEG tube, which is pulled into place by the abdominal operator. The tapered portion of the tube will be the first source of resistance, which may require firm traction. The split wire (and PEG tube) is dropped of the table to the patient's left.

Once the tapered portion of the tube is through the abdominal wall skin, the next point of resistance will be the bumper of the PEG tube passing through the tumor. In general, if a 5mm neonatal scope can pass the tumor, a 20Fr PEG tube can pass as well.

The tube is pulled into position and the measurement at the skin noted. The stomach is aspirated by the upper operator and insufflation is resumed at 8mmHg. Tension on the PEG tube is adjusted to allow apposition of the gastric serosa to the abdominal wall. If the tube is not easily apposed to the abdominal wall, T fasteners (``GI Anchors'') must be employed.

The scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the `First Step' disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.

The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl.

Gastric Mobilization
After infiltration of 1\% marcaine, 7cm upper midline incision made for handport. Small incision is made and pylorus palpated, if possible. Incision is centered over pylorus. GelPort inserted, and abdomen insufflated to 15mmHg. Two 5mm ports placed LUQ. Medial LUQ 5mm port placed in angle between left costal margin and interior edge of GelPort ring. Lateral LUQ 5mm port placed as far lateral as possible. Depending upon visualization, a third port may be required between these two and somewhat more inferior.

If feasible, division of gastrocolic omentum starts by delivering transverse colon into GelPort and dividing ligament with cautery and LigaSure in the avascular plane just cephalad to transverse colon. Dissection proceeds as far proximal and distal and feasible. It is important to avoid damage to the right gastroepiploic artery.

Colon is returned to abdomen and gastricolic ligament divided going using LigaSure, taking care to avoid the colon and the right gastroepiploic artery. Stomach is retracted to the patient's right with the back of the left hand, placing the gastrocolic ligament (and short gastric arteries) on stretch. Left gastroepippoic artery divided with LigaSure near its origin. Short gastric arteries divided with Ligasure close to spleen. As superior aspect of short gastrics is reached, the dissection plane shifts medially to create a tunnel towards the base of the left crus. This places the most superior short gastric vessels on stretch and facilitates their division. Once all short gastric vessels divided, peritoneum tethering fundus to diaphragm is incised, and fundus brushed medially.

If there is bleeding from the splenic hilum this is treated with suction, LigaSure, SurgiFlo, and packing with a vaginal tape with laparotomy ring.

Dissection plane is brought medially and posterior attachments are divided between stomach and pancreas. This may require a Megadyne hook.

Distal mobilization
Attention is directed to mobilizing the lateral aspect of the duodenum. This can either be accomplished with the camera through a LUQ port and a 45 degree camera or by placing an additional 5mm port in the RLQ. Hook cautery is used to incise the connective tissue lateral and posterior to the duodenum. This is extended as far distal as the gastrocolic venous trunk. The gastrocolic ligament is now dissected distally, taking care to preserve the integrity of the right gastroepiploic vessels. An areolar plane generally exists between the fat pad containing the right gastroepiploic vessels and that containing the transverse mesocolon vessels.

Left gastric artery
Lymph nodes around the celiac axis and left gastric artery are now dissected. The extend of dissection depends upon the tumor location and the presence of nodes her either based upon imaging or palpation. Dissection begins on the superior edge of the pancreas, and proceeds superiorly to the right crus. The left gastric (coronary) vein is usually located to the left of the arery and is divided with the LigaSure. In a two-phase approach, the left gastric artery is now divided with a 30mm gray load (2.0mm) endoGIA linear stapler. For patients with mid-esophageal tumors, (for whom a four-phase approach is used), if there is any question about the resectability of the tumor, division of the left gastric gastric artery is generally deferred until the second abdominal phase.

Mediastinal dissection
The esophagus is now dissected circumferentially at the gastroesophageal junction. The peritoneum overlying the diaphragm is incised, and circumferential dissection of esopahgus performed. On the left side, it is helpful to distract the left crus laterally with a Prestige clamp placed on the left crus The right pleura is widely entered in otder to both facilitate the thoracic dissection of the esophagus and placing the conduit into the right chest in preparation for the final thoracic phase. Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the right chest during the first (of two) thoracic phases. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the abdomen by reaching up into the mediastinum to divide the esophagus above the tumor. This is only feasible for tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided with a 60mm Medium-Thich (purple) endoGIA TriStaple stapler.

Division of Esophagus (Four-Phase)
Penrose Drain (Four-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the chest. In order to facilitate the thoracic dissection, a 1/4″ penrose drain is tied around the distal esophagus and the drain is slid cephalad into the mediastinum. The `tails' of the drain are directed into the right chest so that they can be grasped from the right chest during the thoracic phase and can be used to provide traction on the esophagus in order to Entry into right chest The pneumoperitoneum in the abdomen is vented and the gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. The bed is rotated to the left 20 degrees. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. Two 12mm ports are placed. The more superior is placed lateral and superior to the nipple. The inferior port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm `U' port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5

Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase)
In patients with low-lying tumors, it is possible to divide the esophagus above the tumor from the abdominal approach. This evaluation is facilitated by review of the properative endoscopy (and EUS), and the PET scan, particularly the PET obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

After dissection of the mediastinum, a endoGIA stapler with a 60mm Medium-Thick (purple) load is inserted through a 12mm port either placed either through the GelPort or by upsizing the most lateral LUQ

Construction of Conduit
The distal esophagus and stomach is exteriorized through the GelPort. The lesser curvature vessels are divided with the LigaSure 7-9cm cephalad from the pylorus. The stomach is now placed on stretch along the greater curvature. An endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) stapler is used to construct a 5-6cm wide gastric tube. In constructing the conduit in a patient with a tumor of the GE jnction invading into the cardia, it is important to be certain that the staple line to construct the conduit stays clear of the tumor. Patients with tumors invading the cardia are at risk of a positive distal margin, meaning that microscopic tumor may be left in the wall of the gastric conduit. To make things more complicated, in patients with low-lying esophageal or GE junction tumors, not all of the length of the conduit are needed in order to reach to the level of the esophageal transection. After construction of the anastomosis, the `extra' cephalad portion of the conduit (near the angle of His) are excised as the `additional gastric margin.' In order to distinguish which portions of the conduit staple line which will be used to replace the esophagus and those which will be included in the `additional gastric margin', both sides of the gastric conduit staple line are marked with sutures designated `A', `B', `C', etc proceeding from the Angle of His to the antrum.

The distal esophagus and GE junction are now sent for frozen section.

Feeding jejunostomy
The ligament of Trietz is identified and the jejunum is identified 20cm distal and marked with a directional suture. A site is selected to the left of the handport incision. A 16Fr Cook Introducer Kit is used to pass a 16Ga needle, followed by a J wire, through the left rectus muscle. A skin incision 4mm in length is made adjacent to the J wire. The 16Fr dilator and sheath are now passed through the rectus muscle and the dilator and wire removed. A 14Fr Jejunostomy Tube 0301-14 is selected and the `wings' trimmed off with a scalpel. The jejunostomy tube is passed through the peelaway sheath, which is removed.

A pursestring suture 1.5cm in diameter is placed on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum. The pursestring is started and ends on the lateral aspect. A second 16Fr Cook Introduced Kit is used to introduce the J wire through the center of the pursestring.

Placement of Drains
Two (or three) 19Fr full-fluted Blake drains (72230) are placed:

JP1: placed into the left pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the most lateral 5mm port site on the LUQ
JP2: placed into the right pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the next most medial 5mm LUQ port site
JP3: (optional) placed in the abdomen posterior to the left lateral segment of the liver and brought out through the most medial 5mm LUQ port site
Transposition of Conduit
The gastric conduit is now placed into the right pleura through the mediastinum, with the assistance of a laparoscopic Babcock and gentle pressure on the greater curvature with the fingers.

Entrance into the R chest (Two Phase)
For two-phase operations, ports are now placed into the right chest, as stated above . In similar fashion, the inferior pulmonary ligament in dissected and the lung reflected anterior.

Anastomosis
The right chest is entered and the right lung reflected anterior with the paddle placed in the superior/anterior port. The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy. The paddle retractor is now moved from the anterior/inferior port to the anterior/superior 12mm port and the lung reflected anterior and inferior.

OrVil
The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.

The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.

The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device. The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (`sock over shoe'). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.

The anastomosis is completed by firing a endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) linear) across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is sent for pathologic exam as `additional gastric margin.'

NG Tube
A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle.

Chest Tube
A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated.

Closure
The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.

  If PET shows metastatic disease, patients are eligible for palliative chemotherapy with radiation for treatment of symptoms of dysphagia.
\item
  If PET shows extra-regional lymph node disease, patient is at high risk for distant disease and can be treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{staging}{%
\chapter{Staging}\label{staging}}

The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy.

The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with)

The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups:

Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors \textless3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those \(\geq\) 3cm\citep{hollis1114}

Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so \textbf{endoscopic ultrasound} is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis.

Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, \textbf{PET} is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis.

Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering {[}Ripley 226{]} among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89\%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47\%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia.

PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS {[}malik,claxton,1{]} showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm\textsuperscript{3}, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm\textsuperscript{3}.

\hypertarget{superficial}{%
\chapter{Superficial Esophageal Cancer}\label{superficial}}

Superficial esophageal cancer is usually asymptomatic, which means that the diagnosis is generally made in the context of surveillance for Barrett's esophagus.

Nodular Barrett's esophagus can be best evaluation with endoscopic mucosal resection, which can provide further staging information if an adenocarcinoma is found, such as depth of invasion, differentiation, and lymphovascular invasion.

Larger lesions should first be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)?

EUS is less sensitive for T1 lesions \citep{bergeron765} -\textgreater{} use EMR for diagnosis \citep{maish1777}

(Should nodular Barrett's be evaluated with EUS prior to EMR?)

T1a tumors have a low risk of nodal metastasis \citep{dunbar850}

\hypertarget{emr}{%
\section{Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)}\label{emr}}

For patients with nodular Barrett's esophagus or small tumors judged to be T1 by endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) can be diagnostic and potentially curative.\citep{thomas1609}

EMR also helps establish the difference between T1a and T1b compared with pathology \citep{worrell484}

EMR is likely sufficient for small tumors with favorable patholgic factors\citep{pech652} \citep{nurkin1090}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Size less than 2cm
\item
  Lateral and deep margins clear
\item
  Absence of lymphovascular invasion
\item
  Well- or moderately- differentiated
\end{itemize}

EMR for low-grade dysplasia \citep{phoa1209} resulted in 25\% riskd reduction in progression go HGD.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a technique for deeper endoscopic removal of esophageal lesions using endoscopic cautery, which dissects through the submucosa. ESD has a higher rate of curative resection \citep{cao751} albiet at the cost of prolonged operative times and increased risk of complications such a bleeding. \citep{repici715}

ESD takes more time and has higher R0 resection rate but similar recurrence erate at 2 eyars \citep{terheggen783}

Multiple studies have failed to show the additional benefit of chemotherapy or chemoradiation for pT2N0M0 esophageal cancer patients treated with radiation.

Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 {[}Mariette 2416{]} enrolled patients with T1-2 or T3N0 tumors to chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone. The majority of the tumors (72\%) were squamous cell carcinoma.Postoperative mortality was significaly increased in the chemoradiation arm (11.1\% vs 3.4\%).

Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.{[}MOta 176{]}

French trial FREGAT\citep{markar59}

Retrospective review of the National Cancer DataBase failed to demonstrate a difference in survival of cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer with or without preoperative chemoradiation.\citep{speicher1195}

A retrospective report from Johns Hopkins examined outcomes of T2N0 squamous cell carcinoma patients and showed equivalent outcomes for primary surgery vs neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery \citep{zhang429}

\hypertarget{staging-of-t2n0-tumors}{%
\section{Staging of T2N0 Tumors}\label{staging-of-t2n0-tumors}}

The challenge for treatment decision-making is the limited sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound in ruling out pT3 or pN+ disease. In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN\textsuperscript{+} disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a \_\_\_ \% chance of failure to complete therapy.

Data from the Cleveland Clinic looked at 53 patients judged to be T2N0 by endoscopic ultrasound (uT2N0) were treated with primary surgery. Pathologic examination showed that 17 (37\%) were understaged by endoscopic ultrasound, and were pathologic (pT3) in 4 or node positive (pN\textsuperscript{+}) in 13 cases. These patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation.\citep{rice317}

It is critical, therefore, in patients for whom primary surgery is contemplated, to attempt to identify those with occult T3 or N+ disease.

\hypertarget{trimodality}{%
\section{Trimodality Therapy}\label{trimodality}}

Trimodality therapy consists of chemoradiation followed by surgery.

CROSS trial randomized 364 patients with resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors (75\% adenocarcinoma) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisting of 4,140 cGy of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone.\citep{vanhagen2074} Clinical node-positive disease was present in 16\%. Pathologic complete response was seen in 23\% of adenocarcinoma and 49\% of squamous cell carcinomas. Median overall survival was 49 months after trimodality vs 24 months after surgery alone (p=0.003). Squamous cell carcinomas appeared to have particular benefit, with a hazard ratio of 0.42 for squamous cell vs 0.74 for adenocarcinoma. Median survival was improved for adenocarcinoma from 27.1 months to 43.2 months, but the median survival for squamous cell increased from 27.1months to 81.6 months for squamous cell. Rate of R0 resection was higher with chemoradiation (92\% vs 69\% p\textless0.001) andlocal recurrence rates lower (14\% vs 34\% P\textless0.001), and peritoneal recurrence lower (4\% vs 14\% P\textless0.001). Despite the relatively low dose of radiation, in-field recurrences were less than 5\%. The primary cause of failure was distant disease (31\%) and local/regional failure (14\%).\citep{oppedijk385}

Alternative to carbotaxol is FOLFOX (SOG trial \citep{leichman4555})

The study failed to meet its accrual goal, but there was a suggestion of improved 3-year survival with preoperative chemoradiation (47.4\% vs 27.7\% \emph{p}=0.07) as well as improved local control (76.5\% vs 59\%). In addition, chemoradiation was associated with a higher pathologic complete response rate (15.6\% vs 2\%)\citep{stahl851}. A meta-analysis of 33 randomized trials further suggested a greater benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery\citep{pasquali481} and a similar meta-analysis \citep{sjoquist681}

Stahl Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma randomized to induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, etopiside, 5FU with leuocovrin) followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent ciplatin and etopiside) followed by surgery compared with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation (6400cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etopiside).\citep{stahl2310} progression-free survival was better in the trimodality group (64.3\% vs 40.7\%) Treatment-related morality was substantial in the surgery arm (13\% vs 4\%). This would be considered an excessive rate of operative mortality by modern standards. Unsurprisingly, there was no difference in overall survival between groups, in part because the surgical group had an excess 9\% mortality rate from treatment. Two-year survival in the surgery arm was 40\% vs 35\% in the definitive chemoradiation arm.

In the French FFCD trial, 444 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (90\% squamous cell) were treated with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin with concurrent radiation.\citep{bedenne1160} Patients with a partial or complete clinical response to chemoradiation were randomized to either surgery or a boost of radiation. Patients who did not respond to chemoradiation were treated with surgery and were eliminated from the study. Only 259 of the original 444 patients (59\%) went on to randomization, with the remainder (those not responding to chemoradiation) treated with surgery. Of the randomized group, median survival was 17.7months in the surgery arm versus 19.3months in the definitive chemoradiation arm. Like the Stahl study, treatment-related mortality in the surgical arm was high (9\% versus 1\%).

\hypertarget{esophagectomy}{%
\chapter{Esophagectomy}\label{esophagectomy}}

Three general approaches exist for surgical therapy.

Trans-thoracic or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy\citep{visbal1803} removes the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest. The approach include an abdominal phase, during which an esophageal substitute is constructed (usually from stomach). A thoracic phase then removes the intrathoracic esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest cavity.

A McKeown esophagectomy utilizes three surgical fields: abdomen, right chest, and neck. The right chest approach allows dissection of peri-esophageal lymph nodes, and the cervical incision allows removal of the total esophagus.\citep{mckeown259} This approach is useful for tumors which involve the proximal thoracic esophagus, to ensure a negative margin. The cervical anastomosis carries a higher risk of anastomotic leak than a thoracic anastomosis, although the morbidity of a cervical anastomosis leak is less serious than that of a leak of a thoracic anastomosis.

A transhiatal esohpagectomy approaches the esophagus from the abdomen through the hiatus and from neck. By blunt dissection the esophagus is freed up without the need for thoracotomy. An esophageal substute is then brought from the abdomen to the neck through the mediastinum\citep{orringer643} \citep{orringer363}\textless! -- Orringer Ann Surg 2007 --\textgreater{} The operation is designed to avoid the pulmonary toxicity of the right chest approach. On the other hand, the blunt nature of the mediastinal dissection means that fewer lymph nodes are harvested than with a trans-thoracic approach.

Randomized trial of transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection versus transhiatal esohpagectomy showed fewer pulmonary complications with the transhiatal approach. \citep{hulscher1662} Fewer lymph nodes were havested with a transhiatal appraoch. A post-hoc analysis showed that among patients with 1-8 positive lymph nodes, survival with improved with the extended lymph node dissection.\citep{omloo992}

Minimally-invasive approaches to esophagectomy are now common, with evidence for less perioperative morbidity than an open approach \citep{biere1887} \citep{zhoue0132889}

Randomized trial of a hybrid MIE (with laparoscopy and thoracotomy) was associated with lower postoperative complications than open esophagectomy \citep{mariette152}

\textbf{Preop Radiation}

STRASS trial randomized 266 patients to preop radiation followed by surgical resection vs surgery alone. At a median followup of 43 months, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival. Serious adverse affects were more common in the preop radiation group (24\% vs 10\%). One patients in the radiation group died of treatment-related toxicity (gastrocolic fistula), compared with none in the surgery alone group \{bonvalot1366\}. See commentary: \{cardona1257\}
