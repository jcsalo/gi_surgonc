## T2N0 Tumors

Multiple studies have failed to show the additional benefit of chemotherapy or chemoradiation for pT2N0M0 esophageal cancer patients treated with radiation.

Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416] enrolled patients with T1-2 or T3N0 tumors to chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone. The majority of the tumors (72%) were squamous cell carcinoma.Postoperative mortality was significaly increased in the chemoradiation arm (11.1% vs 3.4%).


Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176]


French trial FREGAT[@markar59]

Retrospective review of the National Cancer DataBase failed to demonstrate a difference in survival of cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer with or without preoperative chemoradiation.[@speicher1195]

A retrospective report from Johns Hopkins examined outcomes of T2N0 squamous cell carcinoma patients and showed equivalent outcomes for primary surgery vs neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery [@zhang429]

## Staging of T2N0 Tumors

The challenge for treatment decision-making is the limited sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound in ruling out pT3 or pN+ disease.  In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN^+^ disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a ___ % chance of failure to complete therapy.

Data from the Cleveland Clinic looked at 53 patients judged to be T2N0 by endoscopic ultrasound (uT2N0) were treated with primary surgery. Pathologic examination showed that 17 (37%) were understaged by endoscopic ultrasound, and were pathologic (pT3)  in 4 or node positive (pN^+^) in 13 cases. These patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation.[@rice317]

It is critical, therefore, in patients for whom primary surgery is contemplated, to attempt to identify those with occult T3 or N+ disease.

Patients who appear to have limited stage disease benefit from evaluation with a combination of

##Primary Surgery {#primary_surgery}

NCCN recommends PET scanS

Most common sites of metastasis are liver, lung, bones, adrenal.

PET detects occult metastasis in 10-20% of cases [@kato921,@kim403]. Among 129 patients with esophageal cancer, PET detected additional sites of disease in 41% and changed management in 38% [@chatterton354]


PET for restaging detects interval development of metastatic disease in 8-17% of cases [@vanvliet547]
