**Preop Radiation**

STRASS trial randomized 266 patients to preop radiation followed by surgical resection vs surgery alone. At a median followup of 43 months, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival.  Serious adverse affects were more common in the preop radiation group (24% vs 10%). One patients in the radiation group died of treatment-related toxicity (gastrocolic fistula), compared with none in the surgery alone group {bonvalot1366}.  See commentary: {cardona1257}
